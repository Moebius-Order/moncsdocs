## Project Overview

**MON CS DOCS** is an open-source, community-driven Computer Science documentation platform that emphasizes **theoretical foundations** over code tutorials. We believe understanding *why* systems work is as important as knowing *how* to implement them.

### Mission Statement

To build accessible, high-quality Computer Science documentation that bridges the gap between academic theory and practical engineering — free from advertisements, paywalls, and commercial bias.

### Target Audience

- **Students**: From high school to university-level CS courses
- **Engineers**: Software developers seeking deeper theoretical understanding
- **Researchers**: Academic professionals requiring comprehensive reference materials
- **Self-learners**: Anyone passionate about Computer Science fundamentals

### Management

This project is managed and maintained by **[Moebius Order](https://www.moebiusorder.com)**, a digital organization committed to open educational resources. While the content is open source, the technical infrastructure and platform are developed and operated by Moebius Order.

## Knowledge Pillars

Our documentation is organized into four fundamental pillars of Computer Science:

### Foundational Theory

- **Mathematics for CS**: Discrete mathematics, logic, set theory, graph theory
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Complexity analysis, algorithmic paradigms, advanced data structures
- **Computational Theory**: Automata, formal languages, computability, complexity classes
- **Information Theory**: Encoding, compression, cryptography fundamentals

### Hardware & Architecture

- **Digital Logic**: Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential circuits
- **Computer Organization**: CPU architecture, memory hierarchy, instruction sets
- **Embedded Systems**: Microcontrollers, real-time systems, hardware-software interface
- **Performance Engineering**: Optimization techniques, benchmarking, profiling

### Software Paradigms

- **Programming Principles**: Paradigms (procedural, OOP, functional, declarative)
- **Software Engineering**: Design patterns, testing methodologies, SDLC models
- **Compilers & Languages**: Lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, type systems
- **Operating Systems**: Process management, memory management, file systems, concurrency

### Systems & Networking

- **Network Theory**: OSI model, protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS), network security
- **Distributed Systems**: Consensus algorithms, CAP theorem, distributed databases
- **Database Systems**: Relational theory, normalization, query optimization, NoSQL
- **Security Fundamentals**: Cryptographic protocols, authentication, access control

## Project Duality: Open Content, Private Infrastructure

### Open Source Content

All educational content in this repository is licensed under **[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)**. You are free to:

- View, download, and use the documentation
- Adapt and remix content for your own projects
- Contribute improvements via Pull Requests
- Fork and create derivative educational materials

> **What you can edit**: Markdown files, documentation content, diagrams, examples, and educational materials.

### Private Engine

> **Important Distinction**: While the *content* is open source, the **Moebius Order platform infrastructure** remains **private and proprietary**.

This includes:

- Web application codebase
- Mobile application source code
- Backend services and APIs
- Proprietary rendering engines
- Internal tooling and automation

This repository serves as the content data center, not the application source code.

### Media Assets

All visual resources (images, diagrams, illustrations, SVGs) are maintained in a separate repository:

**[moncsdocs-media](https://github.com/Moebius-Order/moncsdocs-media)** — Official media assets library for MON CS DOCS.

Media contributions follow the same CC BY-SA 4.0 license with additional contributor warranties and copyright protections. See the media repository LICENSE for details.
