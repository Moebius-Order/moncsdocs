# MON CS DOCS Vision

## 1. Purpose

MON CS DOCS exists to provide high-quality, theoretically grounded Computer Science documentation that is free, durable, and globally accessible. The focus is on deep understanding rather than quick-reference snippets.

## 2. Scope

The project covers the core domains of Computer Science through four pillars:

- Foundational Theory
- Hardware & Architecture
- Software Paradigms
- Systems & Networking

The repository is the canonical source of truth for all public documentation content used by the MON CS DOCS platform.

## 3. Vision Statement

MON CS DOCS aims to become a reference-grade Computer Science knowledge base that:

- Bridges academic theory and practical engineering
- Maintains consistent structure, style, and technical accuracy
- Scales to cover the full CS curriculum from high school to advanced university level
- Remains vendor-neutral and free from commercial bias

## 4. Target Users

- Students (secondary school through university)
- Self-learners preparing for exams, interviews, or research
- Software engineers strengthening their theoretical foundation
- Educators seeking supplemental teaching material

## 5. Content Principles

- **Correctness**: All content must be technically accurate, internally consistent, and well-referenced.
- **Clarity**: Explanations prioritize conceptual understanding with minimal jargon and precise language.
- **Structure**: Articles follow shared templates for navigation, prerequisites, and progression.
- **Neutrality**: No marketing content, product promotion, or stack-specific bias.
- **Licensing**: All content is published under CC BY-SA 4.0 with clear attribution rules.

## 6. Pillar Outcomes

### 6.1 Foundational Theory

Goal: A complete, layered path from discrete mathematics and algorithm analysis to complexity, computability, and information theory.

Outcomes:

- Beginner to advanced articles for each major topic (e.g., asymptotic analysis, paradigms, proofs, models of computation)
- Clear prerequisite mapping between topics
- Examples, proofs, and exercises integrated into each article

### 6.2 Hardware & Architecture

Goal: A clear mental model of how modern computers execute programs, manage memory, and move data.

Outcomes:

- Conceptual coverage from digital logic to memory hierarchy and CPU microarchitecture
- Performance-focused explanations of caches, pipelines, and memory access patterns
- Documentation that can inform optimization and systems design work

### 6.3 Software Paradigms

Goal: Explain how different ways of thinking about programs influence design, correctness, and maintainability.

Outcomes:

- Paradigm-focused articles (procedural, object-oriented, functional, declarative)
- Coverage of software engineering practices, testing, and design patterns
- Explanations of compilers, interpreters, and language features at a conceptual level

### 6.4 Systems & Networking

Goal: Provide an end-to-end understanding of how distributed systems and networks behave under real-world constraints.

Outcomes:

- Clear explanations of core protocols, distributed algorithms, databases, and security primitives
- Emphasis on trade-offs (consistency, latency, fault tolerance) rather than implementation details
- Connections between models (e.g., CAP, ACID, BASE) and practical design decisions

## 7. Documentation Quality Targets

- Every article has:
  - Frontmatter metadata (pillar, difficulty, prerequisites, tags)
  - A clear learning objective and summary
  - At least one worked example or scenario
  - References to primary or high-quality secondary sources
- Pillar and topic indexes remain synchronized with the actual directory structure.
- Breaking changes to structure are reflected in templates and contributor guidelines.

## 8. Long-Term Direction

- Expand coverage to include exam- and curriculum-aligned tracks (e.g., NCERT, university syllabi).
- Introduce structured learning paths grouped by difficulty and prerequisites.
- Maintain backward-compatible content structure as the platform evolves.
