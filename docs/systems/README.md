# Systems & Networking

> **Quick Summary**: The protocols, architectures, and principles that enable computers to communicate, coordinate, and work together across networks and distributed environments.

## Overview

Systems & Networking explores how computers communicate and coordinate in connected environments. This pillar covers network protocols, distributed system design, database theory, and security fundamentals—the technologies that power the internet, cloud computing, and modern distributed applications.

**What**: This category encompasses network architecture (OSI model, TCP/IP), network protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP), distributed systems (consensus, replication, consistency), database systems (relational, NoSQL, transactions), and security fundamentals (cryptography, authentication, access control).

**Why**: Understanding systems and networking is essential for:
- Building scalable web applications and services
- Designing distributed systems and microservices
- Working with databases effectively
- Securing systems and protecting data
- Understanding how the internet works

**Where**: These concepts apply everywhere:
- Web development and APIs
- Cloud computing and distributed systems
- Database administration and design
- Cybersecurity and cryptography
- Network engineering and infrastructure

**Impact**: Mastering systems and networking enables you to build modern, scalable, secure applications that span multiple machines and serve millions of users.
